      <h1>Dear Internet,</h1><br>

        When I first logged on, I didn't really have any use
        for you. My family's computer, running Windows Vista,
        could run everything that I wanted to use without
        requiring a connection. CD-ROM games, iTunes, movies. 
        Everything was encoded on discs that I could hold
        and put into the computer. Kinda cool. I knew you were
        there; my dad was always on Firefox, looking at comics
        or playing flash games. For a while, I stuck with the
        discs. Eventually, curiosity got the better of me. My
        dad was always on a site called
        <a href="https://armorgames.com/">Armor Games.</a> One
        particular game stood out to me: 
        <a href="https://armorgames.com/play/1205/warlords">
          Warlords.
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This game fascinated me. You would have a bunch of
        lines, and you and a computer opponent would send 
        troops along each of the lines. They would fight, you 
        would gain or lose ground, and eventually, if enough
        troops from one side reach the other side's keep, the
        battle is won. It was really intense. I wanted to play
        it. So I did. Just like that, I was on the internet.
        Nothing material changed. I was still playing games, 
        like I was before. But I know it was bigger than that.
        Even if I didn't recognize it at the time, my first 
        time using the internet connected me to a wealth of 
        ideas, experiences, and worlds beyond my understanding,
        both as a child and now.

        So why do I write you, O Internet? Now, you dominate
        my life. Every second I'm connected. Streaming audio
        or video. Downloading worksheets, e-books, syllabi. 
        Even texting my friends, something that used to go
        through SMS, now goes through the Internet. It's easy
        to take for granted how consistent you've been in my
        life, but it's undeniable that I owe so much to the 
        infrastructure that keeps you going. My taste in 
        everything is informed by other people on the Internet,
        even by the existence of the internet itself. The 
        aesthetics of the GeoCities-era web, though it wasn't 
        one I was able to experience during its time, has 
        really stuck with me. There's a lot there that I wish
        I could have lived, but I gotta say, I love the 
        <a href="https://gifcities.org/">gifs</a>
        most of all. There are millions of minutes I have 
        spent crawling through the 
        <a href="https://drawception.com/">s</a>

        people have carved out on your wide expanses. I love 
        it all, and I love you, Internet. 
      </p>
      <p>Thanks for everything!</p>
